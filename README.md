# Using Javascript for Belly Button Bacteria Study

## Overview
Created an interactive web dashboard by using Javascript and HTML. The JSON file provided information that 
included:
* ID number associated with the subject 
* The subjects ethnicity 
* The subjects gender 
* The subjects age
* The subjects location
* The subjects belly button type
* The wash frequency of the belly button

## Resources 
### Data Source
* samples.json

### Software
* VS Code
* HTML
* CSS

## Results
The end result for the interavtive web dashboard allowed users to have a visual of the studies shown. To the left of the webpage is a dropdown menu that allows users
to select a test subject by the test subjects ID. By making the selection, the graphs/ charts change according to the test subjects results. The bar graph shows the top ten bacteria 
cultures were found, the guage shows how many times a week that the test subject washed their belly button and the bubble graph on the bottom shows the bacteria cultures per sample.
